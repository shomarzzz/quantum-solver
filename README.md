# quantum-solver
This is a programme that solve the wave function of a particle on a given potential.
* If we run gui.py then we will get "give number of grid points" here we will give the sampling grid points to solve the programme.
* In "give potential" we should give the potential in terms of x i.e. x**2. 
* "bounded range" gives were the particle is bounded. "wave number" is the number of wave we want to see.
* the "see probabilty" checkbox if marked shows the probability of the particle.
* "see all the waves upto that number" checkbox if marked shows the waves all upto that number
* "show potential" shows the potential graph
then if clicked on"show th eplot then it will show the graph of the wave function
